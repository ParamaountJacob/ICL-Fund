### üîß Updated Recommended Next Steps
1. Review and secure database migration scripts
2. Consider comprehensive integration testing for critical paths
3. The majority of application-level issues have been resolved - focus should shift to infrastructure and deployment concerns

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed Items (moved to CODEBASE_ISSUES_DONE.md)
- Fixed RLS bypass fallbacks in `investments.ts` (CRITICAL SECURITY FIX)
