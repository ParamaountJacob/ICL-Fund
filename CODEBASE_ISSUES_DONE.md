## ðŸ”§ Fixed Critical Runtime Issues

### 1. Fixed Missing Imports in `useDashboardData.ts`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Critical  
**File**: `src/hooks/useDashboar### 16. Cleaned Up Production Debug St### 18. Improved Development Logger with Configurable Levels
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Files**: `src/utils/logger.ts`, `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`

**Issue**: Excessive console logging noise in development, including verbose AuthContext debug messages and third-party Sentry debug logs cluttering the console.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced logger utility with configurable log levels (0-4 scale)
- Added `VITE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable support with default level 2 (warnings + errors)
- Converted verbose AuthContext debug messages from `logger.log` to `logger.debug` (level 4)
- Added log level prefixes ([DEBUG], [INFO], [WARN], [ERROR]) for better visibility
- Created comprehensive environment configuration guide
- Documented third-party Sentry logging issues and browser console filtering solutions

**Log Levels**:
- Level 0: Silent (production)
- Level 1: Errors only
- Level 2: Warnings + Errors (default - good for development)
- Level 3: Info + Warnings + Errors
- Level 4: All logs including debug (verbose)

**Impact**: Significantly reduced console noise during development while maintaining essential error logging. Developers can now control verbosity based on their debugging needs.

### 19. Fixed Missing Static Assets Causing 404 Errors
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Files**: `public/manifest.json`, `public/robots.txt`, `public/favicon.ico`, `vite.config.ts`

**Issue**: Repeated 404 errors in development environment due to missing standard web assets that browsers automatically request.

**Root Cause**: Browsers automatically request common files like `/favicon.ico`, `/manifest.json`, and `/robots.txt` even when not explicitly referenced. These were missing from the public directory, causing repeated 404 errors in the console.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created `public/manifest.json` with proper PWA configuration for the ICL Fund app
- Added `public/robots.txt` with appropriate crawling rules (disallowing sensitive routes)
- Created `public/favicon.ico` with SVG-based ICL branding matching the existing favicon.svg
- Enhanced `vite.config.ts` with proper asset handling configuration
- Ensured all public assets are properly copied during build process

**Technical Details**:
- Manifest includes proper app metadata, theme colors, and icon references
- Robots.txt protects admin, profile, and onboarding routes from crawlers
- Favicon.ico provides fallback for browsers that don't support SVG favicons
- Vite config ensures reliable asset serving in development and production

**Impact**: Eliminates console noise from repeated 404 requests, improves development experience, and provides proper PWA foundation for future enhancements.

### 20. Resolved Development Server Port Conflicts
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High  
**Files**: `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`

**Issue**: Development server unable to start due to port 5173 conflicts, preventing local development and testing.

**Root Cause**: Vite's default port 5173 was already in use by another service, causing the development server to fail to start.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Changed default development port** from 5173 to 3000 in `vite.config.ts`
- **Added server configuration** with auto-open browser and external access support
- **Created alternative port scripts** in package.json for different scenarios:
  - `npm run dev` - Port 3000 (default)
  - `npm run dev:3001` - Port 3001 (alternative)
  - `npm run dev:4000` - Port 4000 (alternative)
  - `npm run dev:8080` - Port 8080 (alternative)
- **Enhanced ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md** with port management guide and conflict resolution steps
- **Added host: true** for testing on mobile devices and other network devices

**Technical Details**:
- Server auto-opens browser on successful start
- Supports external connections for multi-device testing
- Provides multiple fallback port options
- Includes command-line guidance for custom ports

**Impact**: Resolves development server startup issues, provides flexible port management, and enables reliable local development workflow.

**Issue**: Excessive debug console.log statements left in production code, potentially exposing sensitive user information in browser console and cluttering output.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Removed 6 debug console.log statements from DataRoom.tsx including user auth details, emails, roles, and user objects
- Removed 8 debug console.log statements from AuthContext.tsx during authentication state changes
- Retained only essential error logging with console.error for production debugging
- Kept structured logging via logger service for proper debugging infrastructure
- Removed file upload detail logging that could expose sensitive file information

**Impact**: Enhanced security by preventing user data exposure, cleaner console output for users and developers, better separation between debug and production logging.

### 2. Fixed Missing State Declaration in `AuthContext.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Critical  
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Issue**: Lines 165, 172 called `setIsInitialized(true)` but `isInitialized` state was never declared with `useState`.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added missing state declaration: `const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);`

**Impact**: Prevents runtime errors and ensures proper auth initialization tracking.

---

### 3. Fixed Memory Leaks from Uncleaned setTimeout in `AuthContext.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High  
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Issue**: Lines 57, 66, 130, 142 had `setTimeout` handles in `Promise.race` that were never cleared, causing memory leaks.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `timeoutsRef` to track timeout handles
- Added `createTimeoutPromise()` helper function that registers timeouts for cleanup
- Added `clearAllTimeouts()` function to clean up all timeouts
- Modified cleanup function in useEffect to call `clearAllTimeouts()` and set `mountedRef.current = false`
- Replaced all direct `setTimeout` calls with the managed `createTimeoutPromise()` helper

**Impact**: Eliminates memory leaks from timeout handles and improves component cleanup.

### 4. Improved Navigation Pattern in `AuthContext.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Issue**: Lines 199, 207 used `window.location.href = '/'` instead of proper React navigation patterns.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `signOut` function to accept optional `navigateCallback?: () => void` parameter
- Updated `AuthContextType` interface to reflect the new signature
- Implemented fallback to `window.location.href` when no callback is provided (maintaining backward compatibility)
- Components can now pass proper React Router navigation functions

**Impact**: Provides better navigation control and maintains React Router state while ensuring backward compatibility.

### 5. Fixed Performance Issues in `usePerformance.ts`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**File**: `src/hooks/usePerformance.ts`

**Issue**: `useThrottle()` calculated next delay with `Date.now()` instead of `performance.now()`, leading to potential clock-skew bugs.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced all `Date.now()` calls with `performance.now()` in the `useThrottle` hook
- This provides monotonic timing that's not affected by system clock changes

**Impact**: More reliable throttling behavior, especially on systems with clock adjustments.

### 6. Fixed Subscription Memory Leaks in `notifications.ts`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High  
**File**: `src/lib/notifications.ts`

**Issue**: `subscribeToNotifications()` and missing `subscribeToAdminAlerts()` returned channel subscription but didn't provide cleanup mechanism for React components, causing memory leaks.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `subscribeToNotifications()` to return object with `unsubscribe()` method
- Added missing `subscribeToAdminAlerts()` function with proper cleanup pattern
- Both functions now return `{ channel, unsubscribe: () => supabase.removeChannel(channel) }`

**Impact**: Prevents memory leaks from uncleaned real-time subscriptions and provides consistent cleanup API.

### 7. Enhanced Error Handling in `UserProfileModal`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**File**: `src/components/UserProfileModal/index.tsx`

**Issue**: Component caught errors but rendered nothing, leaving the modal blank instead of showing an error state.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `error` state to track error conditions
- Modified `fetchUserData()` to set error state on failures
- Added error state UI with retry button and user-friendly error message
- Clear error state when retrying or loading new data

**Impact**: Users now see helpful error messages instead of blank modals, with ability to retry failed operations.

---

### 8. Fixed React Anti-patterns in `DataRoom.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**File**: `src/pages/DataRoom.tsx`

**Issues**: 
- Lines 31-35: Direct style injection into `document.head` is an anti-pattern in React
- Line 67: Uses `any[]` type instead of proper typing

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Replaced direct DOM manipulation with `DataRoomStyles` component using React `<style>` tag
- Created `DataRoomFile` interface with proper typing for file objects
- Updated `files` state to use `DataRoomFile[]` instead of `any[]`
- Removed unsafe `document.head.appendChild()` pattern

**Impact**: Better React practices, improved type safety, and no direct DOM manipulation outside React lifecycle.

---

### 9. Improved Error Handling in `documents.ts`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High  
**File**: `src/lib/documents.ts`

**Issue**: `sendAdminNotification()` swallowed notification errors silently, which could leave critical processes incomplete without proper feedback.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `sendAdminNotification()` to return boolean success/failure status
- Added explicit warning logs when notifications fail but don't break the main flow
- Enhanced caller to check notification status and log warnings
- Maintained non-blocking behavior while providing better visibility into failures

**Impact**: Better visibility into notification failures while maintaining system stability.

### 10. Refactored Direct Supabase Calls in `ConsultationForm.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**File**: `src/components/ConsultationForm.tsx`

**Issue**: Component still called `supabase.from('user_profiles')` directly, duplicating logic available in `profileService` and `crmService`.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced direct Supabase profile upsert with `profileService.updateUserProfile()`
- Replaced direct consultation creation with `crmService.createConsultationRequest()`
- Removed dependency on direct database access in favor of service layer
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving code consistency

**Impact**: Better separation of concerns, reduced code duplication, and consistent use of service layer patterns.

### 11. Added Missing `useDebouncedValue` Function
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**File**: `src/hooks/usePerformance.ts`

**Issue**: Function `useDebouncedValue()` was referenced but not implemented, and would return previous value on first call, breaking controlled inputs.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `useDebouncedValue` function with first-call immediate value setting
- Used `useRef` to track first render and immediately set value without delay
- Subsequent calls use normal debounce behavior
- Prevents controlled input issues from stale initial values

**Impact**: Provides proper debounced value hook for controlled inputs without first-call delay issues.

### 12. Removed Unsafe RLS Bypass Fallbacks in `investments.ts`
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Critical  
**File**: `src/lib/investments.ts`

**Issue**: `getUserInvestmentsWithApplications()` and `getAdminInvestmentsWithUsers()` fell back to client-side queries when RPC functions failed, bypassing Row Level Security and potentially exposing data across tenants.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed unsafe fallback queries that bypassed RLS
- Modified functions to throw clear errors when RPC functions fail
- Enhanced error messages to indicate the specific RPC function that failed
- Forces proper server-side RLS enforcement without fallback compromise

**Impact**: Eliminates potential data leakage across tenants and ensures RLS is always enforced. Critical security improvement.

**Priority**: High  
**Files**: `src/types/notifications.ts`, `src/lib/notifications.ts`, `src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`, `src/components/NotificationModal.tsx`

**Issue**: Duplicate Notification interface definitions across multiple files causing type inconsistencies and potential runtime errors.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created unified notification type system in `src/types/notifications.ts`
- Defined comprehensive type hierarchy:
  - `DatabaseNotification` - for database-stored notifications
  - `UINotification` - for UI toast notifications  
  - `Notification` - unified interface extending DatabaseNotification
  - `NotificationPayload` - for real-time subscription payloads
  - `AdminNotification` - for admin-specific notifications
- Updated all notification-related files to use unified types
- Eliminated duplicate interface definitions
- Enhanced type safety across notification system
